Swimming Stats 

# Author
Brandon Gorter, a Junior at Shakopee High School taking AP Computer Science Principles. I went into this course not knowing much about computer science or coding, but now I have a greater understanding of computer science and thanks to this class, I may be considering computer science as a possible carrer path.

# Description
Every swimmer has swam too many events to remember every time they have gotten and that is where Swimming Stats comes in. Every time you race, enter your information and it is stored in the database to be easily referenced later. This website was made using Cloud9 templates and is for a final project of the AP Computer Science Principles course.

# Files Used:
PHP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS

# How to Use
1. Enter date, time, stroke, and distance of event
2. Click enter to submit a new entry into the database
3. Enter a stroke and distance that is already in the database, enter a new date and time, and click edit to change the data
4. Enter a date, time, stroke, and distance that is already in the database and click delete to remove that data.

# How it was Made
I learned how to use the required languages through the PLTW lessons in class and started by creating a database using phpmyadmin. I then made a PHP file creating all of the variables and the mysql queries I would need to use the database in my website. I then used HTML within the PHP file to structure the website and used JavaScript and CSS to style the website and add a little interaction to the website.
