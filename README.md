This website was created by Brandon Gorter, who learned everything needed to create this website by taking Computer Science Principles. The website was created using a PHP file that has HTML and Javascript embedded into the file and references a separate CSS file to style it up. Swimming Stats allows the user to enter in times to a database that they achieved in the sport of swimming. It makes it easy to view the times that were entered, delete times, and even edit times if they improved in one of their races.
